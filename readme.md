# macOS Setup
Various scripts, personalised to me, that I run when setting up a new mac to install apps & apply preferences etc. Feel free to take a look and use any of the code for your own setup scripts.

## Steps
1. Install fonts for Powerlevel10k Zsh theme from fonts folder and set terminal to use them
2. Run zsh.sh and add plugins to .zshrc file
3. Run setup.sh to do the rest (homebrew, node, git, macos, xcode)
